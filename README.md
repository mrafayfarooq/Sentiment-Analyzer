# Sentiment-Analyzer
A small prototype for the research I have done on my final year project. The prototype has following workflow:<br />
1. Take a sample text from user. <br />
2. Remove stop words from the free text. <br />
3. Read Negations from file. <br />
4. Tokenize Text. <br />
5. Find sentiment score using AFFIN and CSUIC dictionaries.<br /> 
6. Normalize sentiment score. <br />
